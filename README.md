# Project: Iris Flowers Predictor
# Version: 1.2.0

# Description:
This is a medium-sized C++ program that will predict what kind of Iris Flower you have. 
It does this by taking the length and width of the Sepal and Petal that you have and the Iris-Dataset csv file for data to power its predictions.
This program exercises Machine Learning by taking in values for a new Iris flower.
It uses data from the famous iris dataset, and then processes the new input.
Afterwards, it will show how confidient it is in its prediction, and then add the new flower in as the
type it is most sure that it is. 

# Note:
The CSV file data goes, Sepal Width, Sepal Length, Petal Width, Petal Length, Iris Type

# C++ Concepts Used:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Control Structures
- Memory Management
- Function Overloading and Default Parameters
  
# Machine Learning Concepts Used:
- Statistical Analysis
- Gaussian (Normal) Distribution
- Likelihood Estimation
- Confidence Calculation
- Feature Extraction
- Predictive Modeling
  
# Note:
This is an upgraded version of the original version found here:

# Version History:

# V-1.00: (3-29-24 - 4-9-24)
Initial Version <br>
Uploaded to Github

# V-1.10: (4-12-24)
Users can now only input one flower per session <br>
Added more comments explaining the logic and code

# V-1.20: (4-17-24)
Formatted the confidence to come out as a percentage <br>
Added more comments explaining the logic and code <br>
Created a PowerPoint that briefly explains the program

# Current Features as of V-1.10:
- Takes 4 variable values from the user about an Iris flower type 
- Uses the data from the famous Iris flower dataset to predict the likeihood of what type of flower the user may have
- Provides an accurate prediction of the user's flower type
- Dynamic allocation of memory for data structures
- Dynamic addition of new Iris types


# Future Features to Implement:
- Implement a cleaner UI


# Known Bugs in V-1.20:
- Error is suffered when trying to input two flowers in one session.
- Number of iris flowers becomes incorrect when trying to input two flowers in one session.
